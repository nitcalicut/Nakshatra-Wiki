    information.

  * Added Chinese (simplified) language files
    Thanks to LAINME :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Addition -> $conf['disableactions']: respect disabled "search" and "profile"

  * Added /user/tracker.php to make web analytics software integration easier
    See README for details.


2010-08-16  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Changed list styles (<ul>, <ol> -> list-style-image and indentation/margin)
    They are finally looking like the ones of the MediaWiki vector. If you want
    the previous indentation back, put the following into your /user/screen.css:
      div#content .dokuwiki ul {
        margin: 0 0 0.8em 3.5em !important;
      }

  * CSS-fix: Wrong font-site for <code> and <pre> @ insitu-footnotes

  * Changed Table of contents (TOC) styles
    Now it looks as usual (compared with the default tamplate)


2010-06-29  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Corrected small typos in Italian and Dutch language files


2010-06-28 Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Template respects $conf['disableactions']
    Links to disabled functions should be hidden now.

  * Mediamanager CSS improved


2010-06-27  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * New config option: closed wiki
    If active, most tabs/boxes will be hidden until user is logged in.

  * Added Italian language files
    Thanks to Luigi Micco :-) (see CREDITS for details).


2010-06-26  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * New config option: user pages
    You can (de)activate user pages now + choose a custom namespace for them.

  * Support for PNG favicons
    I do NOT recommend PNG for favicons (cause it is not supported by
    all browsers), but some users requested this feature. See README for
    details.

  * Fixed bug: "wrong link (double slash in front) when urlrewriteing is active"
    I replaced all "wl(getID())" with "wl(cleanID(getID())". Additionally, all
    "auth_quickaclcheck(trim($id, ":))" where replaced with
    "auth_quickaclcheck(cleanID($id))". See comment on
    <http://bugs.splitbrain.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=1983> for details.

  * Fixed bug: "wrong CSS within site wide notice"

  * Minor CSS improvements (screen and print layout)
