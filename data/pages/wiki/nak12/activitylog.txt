| ::: | Addy, Vipin | Discussed and decided on the theme for Nak'12 as **scripting** in the Main Canteen after horrible lunch (Gobi Manchurian is absolutely revolting!). The official title for Nakshatra '12 was tentatively decided as **'ManUScript'**. |

| 2nd Year MCA | A meeting was held amongst the 2nd years regarding Nakshatra where students were asked to volunteer for teams. All volunteers in a team were required to elect one coordinator for their team. A few 3rd years were nominated for 'Nakshatra Convener', and these names were relayed to the 3rd years for them to ultimately elect one. Avinesh Saini & Ritwik Dey took initiative for the meeting.|
