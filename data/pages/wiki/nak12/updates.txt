====== The Latest Nak'12 Buzz ====== 

  * The theme for Nakshatra has been chosen as **scripting**. The tentative title for Nakshatra has been decided as **//'ManUScript'//** (Man stands for manual, U stands for You, Script stands for Scripting. Refer to the **Man**ual, and **U** can start **Script**ing). \\ The theme //'Scripting'// gives us tremendous freedom to organize from a wide array of brilliant technical events which involve coding in PHP, Python, BASH, Javascript and other scripting and programming languages as well as use of Databases, Networks and other areas!

  * **A Discussion Page has been added for every page in the wiki.** Each page in the wiki has a discussion page, which can be accessed using the 'Discussion' tab placed next to the 'Article' tab at the top of the page. //For example, if you wish to make suggestions or have queries regarding the content of this page, such as the title for Nak'12 or the theme, click on the Discussion tab that you see on the top, and fire away!// \\ **The Discussion Page is visible only if you are logged in!!**
