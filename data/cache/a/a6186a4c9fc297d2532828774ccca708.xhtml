<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The theme for Nakshatra has been chosen as <strong>scripting</strong>. The tentative title for Nakshatra has been decided as <strong><em>&#039;ManUScript&#039;</em></strong> (Man stands for manual, U stands for You, Script stands for Scripting. Refer to the <strong>Man</strong>ual, and <strong>U</strong> can start <strong>Script</strong>ing). <br/>
The theme <em>&#039;Scripting&#039;</em> gives us tremendous freedom to organize from a wide array of brilliant technical events which involve coding in <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>, Python, BASH, Javascript and other scripting and programming languages as well as use of Databases, Networks and other areas!</div>
